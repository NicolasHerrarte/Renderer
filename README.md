# Renderer
This is a linear algebra inspired project after watching gilbert strang's lectures on MIT OCW. It is a 3D renderer using only numpy for matrix functions

Tree library for visualization of trees

Main File: It is the one responsible for running the pygame looping allowing the 3D rendering window, it creates the camera and respective objects

Camera: Responsibe for the camera and its functionaity

Objects: Responsible for the creation of preconfigured 3D rendered objects

Matrix: Rotation and general specific matrix functions not present on numpy

Discrete: Functions related to nodes, edges and graphs

Playground: General file I personally use to test dummy ideas and functions without utilizing main files

Any suggestions or help is greatly appreciated
